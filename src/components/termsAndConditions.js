              reject applicants for any reason or manner, including but not
              limited to a website or social media page which violates our
              Acceptable Use Policy. If your Affiliate Application is rejected,
              you may not reapply. If your Affiliate Application is accepted,
              each of the terms and conditions in this Agreement apply to your
              participation. We may also ask for additional information to
              complete your Affiliate Application or for you to undertake
              additional steps to ensure eligibility in the Affiliate Program.

            <h2 className="heading2-tandc"> 4) NON-EXCLUSIVITY </h2>
            <p>

            <h2 className="heading2-tandc">5) AFFILIATE PROGRAM </h2>
            <p>
              After your acceptance in the Affiliate Program, you must ensure
              your account is set up thoroughly, including specific payout
              information and location (such as a bank or online account which
              we may use to post payment). Please be advised the below is a
              general description of the Affiliate Program. Everything contained
              in this subsection is subject to the specific terms and conditions
              throughout the rest of this Agreement. We will provide you with a
              specific link or links which correspond to certain products we are
              offering for sale (collectively, the “Link”). The Link will be
              keyed to your identity and will send online users to the Company’s
              website or websites. You hereby agree to fully cooperate with us
              regarding the Link and that you will explicitly comply with all of
              the terms of this Agreement for the promotion of the Link at all
              times. We may modify the specific link or links and will notify
              you if we do so. You agree to only use links which are prior
              approved by us and to display the Link prominently on your website
              or social media page, as described in your Affiliate Application
              (collectively, the “Affiliate Site”). Each time a user clicks
              through the Link posted on the Affiliate Site and completes the
              sale of the product or service and we determine it is a Qualified
              Purchase, as described below, you will be eligible to receive the
              following percentage of the sale: 20% (twenty percent).

            <h2 className="heading2-tandc"> 6) SPECIFIC TERMS APPLICABLE</h2>
            <p>
              We will determine whether payout is permissible in our sole and
              exclusive discretion. We reserve the right to reject clicks and/or
              sales that do not comply with the terms of this Agreement.

              through the portal on which you log into the website. As described
              above, in order to be eligible for payout, user purchases must be

              Affiliate Program. It can be terminated by either Party at any
              time with or without cause. You may only earn payouts as long as
              you are an Affiliate in good standing during the term. If you
              terminate this Agreement with us, you will qualify to receive
              payouts earned prior to the date of termination. If you fail to
              follow the terms of this Agreement or any other legal terms we
              have posted anywhere on our website or websites, you forfeit all
              rights, including the right to any unclaimed payout. We

              Company or a third party, failing to comply with applicable laws
              or other legal obligations, and/or publishing or distributing
              illegal material. At the termination of this Agreement, any
              provisions that would be expected to survive termination by their
              nature shall remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

                first attempt to resolve the dispute personally and in good
                faith. If these personal resolution attempts fail, the Parties
                shall then submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The
                arbitration shall be conducted in the following county: Thousand
                Oaks. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator,

                the provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or
                certify a class. The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and
                governing Federal law as well as the law of California. Each

                sub-part, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this
                sub-part of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a

                transferred by the Company, the rights and liabilities of the

                F) NO WAIVER: In the event that we fail to enforce any provision
                of this Agreement, this shall not constitute a waiver of any
                future enforcement of that provision or of any other provision.
